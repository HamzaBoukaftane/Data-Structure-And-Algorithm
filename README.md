# Data_Structure_And_Algorithm

This repository provides implementations of various fundamental data structures and algorithms in an easy-to-understand manner.

**Data Structures:**

* **Binary Search Trees:** Efficient search and manipulation of sorted data.
* **AVL Trees:** Self-balancing binary search trees for guaranteed logarithmic time operations.
* **Graphs:** Representation of relationships between objects using nodes and edges.
* **HashMaps:** Associative arrays for fast key-value lookups.
* **Heaps:** Priority queues for efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element.

**Algorithms:**

(You can add specific algorithms related to the data structures mentioned above as you implement them)

* Sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort) for ordering elements.
* Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search) for finding elements within a data structure.
* Graph algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search) for traversing or searching graph structures.
* Other differents algorithms

**Getting Started:**

This repository is designed to be language-agnostic, focusing on the core concepts of data structures and algorithms. You can implement these structures and algorithms in your preferred programming language.

**Contribution**

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you have an implementation of a data structure or algorithm that you'd like to share, feel free to submit a pull request.
